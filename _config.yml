  I'm a Canadian student completing the 5th year of my Bachelors of Engineering in the program Software Engineering and Management at Mcmaster University. I have completed 24 months of internship in the AV simulation and aviation spaces.
  I am very interested in simulation, perception and controls. I am skilled at programming and enjoy exploring ML applications.
