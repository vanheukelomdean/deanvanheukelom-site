  Hi, my name's Dean Van Heukelom and I'm a student enrolled in Software Engineering at McMaster University. I am currently enrolled in level 4 of 5 in my program after returning from completing 16 months of internships. 
  I am most interested in deep learning, computer vision, sensor fusion and robotics. I am skilled at programming, designing software pipelines, high dimensional data manipulation and web development.
