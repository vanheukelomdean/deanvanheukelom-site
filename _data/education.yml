    At Mcmaster I am learning many career transferrable skills in leadership and effectively managing several projects at once to meet milestones on-time.
    My fifth year courses are focused on predictive control, machine learning and real-time systems.

    I am a member of the *McMaster AI Society* and spend much of my time participating in intramural sports.
